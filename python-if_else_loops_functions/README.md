# Python If/Else, Loops, and Functions

## Project Overview

This project contains a series of Python exercises designed to teach the fundamentals of **Python programming**, focusing on:

- Control flow using `if`, `if...else`, and conditional statements
- Loops with `for` and `while`
- Working with numbers and strings
- Writing and using functions
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Understanding variable scope and return values
- Proper code style and formatting

Through these exercises, learners practice **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking** while building small Python programs that follow strict style and behavior rules.

## Project Goals

By completing these exercises, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of **indentation** in Python
- Use conditional statements to control program flow
- Work with loops and loop controls (`break`, `continue`, `else`)
- Manipulate strings and numbers without relying on external modules
- Create and use Python functions
- Return values correctly and understand function outputs
- Debug Python programs and interpret tracebacks
- Follow **Python coding style guidelines** strictly

---

## Requirements

- Python scripts must run on **Python 3.8** or later.  
- Files must be **executable** (`chmod +x filename.py`) and start with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

- All files must end with a **newline**.
- Only allowed Python built-in features can be used (no external modules unless specified).
- Code must comply with pycodestyle `2.7.*`.

## Exercises

This project contains **12 exercises**, each focusing on a fundamental conceot:

| Task | File                        | Description                                                                  |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | `0-positive_or_negative.py` | Assigns a random number and prints if it is positive, negative, or zero.     |
| 1    | `1-last_digit.py`           | Prints the last digit of a random number and evaluates its value.            |
| 2    | `2-print_alphabet.py`       | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, in a single line without newline.          |
| 3    | `3-print_alphabt.py`        | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding `q` and `e`.                     |
| 4    | `4-print_hexa.py`           | Prints numbers 0–98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.                       |
| 5    | `5-print_comb2.py`          | Prints numbers 0–99 in two digits, separated by comma and space.             |
| 6    | `6-print_comb3.py`          | Prints all possible combinations of two different digits in ascending order. |
| 7    | `7-islower.py`              | Function to check if a character is lowercase.                               |
| 8    | `8-uppercase.py`            | Function to print a string in uppercase without using `str.upper()`.         |
| 9    | `9-print_last_digit.py`     | Function to print and return the last digit of a number.                     |
| 10   | `10-add.py`                 | Function that returns the sum of two integers.                               |
| 11   | `11-pow.py`                 | Function that returns the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`.           |
| 12   | `12-fizzbuzz.py`            | Function that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with FizzBuzz rules.              |
